ðŸ”¹ Flexible Audio Support: Accepts multiple audio formats, automatically validating each file type and quality for seamless transcription.

ðŸ”¹ Optimized Processing with Threading: By implementing Pythonâ€™s ThreadPoolExecutor, the application splits audio into chunks and processes them concurrently. This approach significantly accelerates transcription speed, ensuring faster turnaround times even with longer files.

ðŸ”¹ Automated Email Delivery for Large Files: For larger audio files, transcription is processed in the background, and upon completion, the PDF transcript is automatically sent to the userâ€™s email via MailerSendâ€™s SMTP Free Serverâ€”eliminating any wait time on the user's end.

ðŸ”¹ Error Handling & Reliability: The code includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. It validates file format and email correctness, manages server timeout errors, enforces maximum file size limits, and more, to make the application as user-friendly and reliable as possible.

ðŸ”¹ Professional PDF Output: Once the transcription is complete, the output is formatted into a clear, organized PDF document for easy download and sharing.

This project showcases my capabilities in AI-driven development, multithreading for high performance, and error resilience in backend development. The potential applications of this tool are vast, from accessibility improvements to professional transcription services across industries.
