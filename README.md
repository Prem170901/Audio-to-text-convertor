## Features

ðŸ”¹ **Flexible Audio Support**  
Accepts multiple audio formats, automatically validating each file type and quality for seamless transcription.

ðŸ”¹ **Optimized Processing with Threading**  
Leverages Pythonâ€™s `ThreadPoolExecutor` to split audio into chunks and process them concurrently. This significantly boosts transcription speed, especially for longer audio files.

ðŸ”¹ **Automated Email Delivery for Large Files**  
Transcriptions of large audio files are processed in the background. Upon completion, the resulting PDF is automatically emailed to the user via MailerSendâ€™s SMTP Free Serverâ€”removing wait times and enhancing usability.

ðŸ”¹ **Error Handling & Reliability**  
Built-in robust error handling ensures a smooth experience. The system validates file types and email addresses, manages server timeouts, and enforces file size limits to maintain performance and stability.

ðŸ”¹ **Professional PDF Output**  
Final transcriptions are formatted into clean, well-structured PDF documents, ready for download and sharing.
